# Skin-Lesion-Segmentation
# Final Year Project

This project was developed as our Final Year Project in college by a team of three. The objective was to detect skin lesions from dermoscopic images using Machine Learning and Image Processing techniques.

We utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify skin lesions, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed for feature extraction. K-Means Clustering was used for image segmentation, allowing better visualization of the affected areas.

The dataset used for training and testing was the ISIC Dataset, which was preprocessed to enhance image quality and remove noise. The backend was built using Python (Flask framework), handling image uploads and model predictions. A MySQL database was integrated to store image data and segmentation results.

Technologies Used:

Machine Learning: CNN, PCA, K-Means Clustering

Programming Languages: Python

Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Flask

Database: MySQL

Frontend: HTML, CSS

This project provided us with hands-on experience in developing AI-powered medical imaging applications, working with real-world datasets, and integrating deep learning models with web applications.
